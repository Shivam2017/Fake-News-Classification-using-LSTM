Fake news Classification Using RNN LSTM 

#### Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data

Dataset has been taken from Kaggle, which consist of 18285 DataPoint. 
Steps involved in building this classifier:
* Data Pre-Processing
* One-Hot ENcoding
* Word Embedding
* Model Crealtion
* Model Training
* Accuracy Report

Further Improvement Needed
  Need to do Hyper Parameter Tuning
